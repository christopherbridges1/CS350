# CS350
Module 8

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, we created a prototype of a thermostat and the logic behind it. A Raspberry Pi served as the controller and python code was used to create the program. 


What did you do particularly well?
I was able to quickly connect the physical components and begin working on the code.  

Where could you improve?
I encountered issues when intializing the lights. After several attempts I finally located the problem in my code and resolved the issue. I could have improved my debugging process to make the process quicker. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The ability to attach devices to a microcontroller and operate it using Python.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The ability to use GPIO and understand how it functions. I have many devices with GPIO and I can start developing various things for them now. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code was modular and used industry standard commenting. I can return to this code after some time and quickly see what it was used for, and how it operates.
